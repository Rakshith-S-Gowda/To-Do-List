1. Set Up Your Environment:
• Make sure to have Python installed on your machine.
2. Project Structure:
• Organize your project into files, such as:
/todo_app
 ├── todo.py # Main application logic
 ├── tasks.json # File to store tasks (or tasks.csv)
 └── README.md # Documentation
3. Implement Core Features:
• Task Class: Define a class to represent a task:
class Task:
 def __init__(self, title, description, category):
 self.title = title
 self.description = description
 self.category = category
 self.completed = False
 def mark_completed(self):
 self.completed = True
• File Handling: Write functions to save and load tasks from a JSON file:
import json
def save_tasks(tasks):
 with open('tasks.json', 'w') as f:
 json.dump([task.__dict__ for task in tasks], f)
def load_tasks():
 try:
 with open('tasks.json', 'r') as f:
 return [Task(**data) for data in json.load(f)]
 except FileNotFoundError:
 return []
4. User Interaction:
• Implement a simple command-line interface to interact with the user:
def main():
 tasks = load_tasks()
 while True:
 print("1. Add Task")
 print("2. View Tasks")
 print("3. Mark Task Completed")
 print("4. Delete Task")
 print("5. Exit")
 choice = input("Choose an option: ")
 if choice == '1':
 # Code to add a task
 elif choice == '2':
 # Code to display tasks
 elif choice == '3':
 # Code to mark a task as completed
 elif choice == '4':
 # Code to delete a task
 elif choice == '5':
 save_tasks(tasks)
 break
